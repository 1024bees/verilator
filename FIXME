Option to turn on/off timing in a given module/section of code

FIXME change didn't converge to look for reentry with time not going forward e.g. 100 times

//          b: ...
//      Becomes
//        ??
//        need to know what is pending so join will go better
//        the FSM technique seems better for this

// FIXME if have huge list of statements
//  #1; transaction;
//  #1; transaction;
//  #1; transaction;
//  #1; transaction;
// Then we'll make an event for each one.  Less code space use FSM.  Jump technique
// will result in lots of optimization explosion and work.
// Note this tradeoff in header of new Visitor.cpp



Test:  initial, always, if, for, while, break, continue, return

FIXME Optimizations
            // 2. Remove goto, if code is "flat" (no if/while) then paste in "fsm" if statement.
            // If code has a "while 1" then circle around

                //7. Remove setting FSM to value it already is
                //data.fsm = 2;

                //5. If while loop only has single pass with goto out of it, remove while and goto
                //5: goto bottom;
